# Full-stack Coding Challenge

This is my solution to the Full-stack coding challenge. The accompanying video can be found [here](https://youtu.be/3X8rilE6im4).

This code is exactly the one that I ended up with in the video. This README is the only thing I'm editing after the fact, no other improvements or refactors were added. I choose to do this in order to abide by the estimate time of completion of 1 hour, to be fair to other applicants and to respect my own time as well.

With the benefit of hindsight, I realize that I could've done a lot of things better, and
that my solution is not optimal. I also realize some of the requirements may also be interpreted differently. I know that the solution isn't the (entire) point of the
exercise, but I feel the need to point this out.

Answers to the extra questions can be found in the video, in the corresponding section.
